2. Classes– Classes are blueprint of an Object. A class can have many Objects because class is a template while Object are instances of the class or the concrete implementation. 
Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented Language there are no classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesn’t have classes, rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuse it using the prototype. 


JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax is not introducing a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript. JavaScript classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.
